Assignment No.: 02 (A) - Oprhan State 
Title: Implement the C program in which main program accepts the integers to be sorted. Main program usesthe FORK system call to create a new process called a child process. Parent process sortsthe integers using sorting algorithm and waits for child process using WAIT system call to sort the integers using any  sorting algorithm. Also demonstrate zombie and orphan states.

Code:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<sys/types.h>
#include<sys/wait.h>
#include<unistd.h>

void main(void)
{
	pid_t cpid, pid;
	int status;
	cpid = fork();
	
	if(cpid == 0) //child 
	{
		printf("\nThis is child process");
		printf("\nChild: My process id is %d ", getpid());
		printf("\nChild: My parent process id is %d ",getppid());
		sleep(3);
		printf("\n*** Child exiting ***\n");
		printf("* This is orphan state *");
	}
	else 	// parent 
	{
		printf("\nThis is child process");
		printf("\nParent: My process id is %d ", getpid());
		printf("\nParent: My parent process id is %d ",getppid());
		printf("\n*** Parent detects process %d is finished! with status %d ***\n", pid, status);
		printf("\n*** Parent exiting ***\n");
	}
}

Terminal Output:
gcc orphan.c
./a.out

This is child process
Parent: My process id is 3598 
Parent: My parent process id is 3567 
*** Parent detects process 0 is finished! with status 0 ***

*** Parent exiting ***
 
This is child process
Child: My process id is 3599 
Child: My parent process id is 1430 
*** Child exiting ***
* This is orphan state *
